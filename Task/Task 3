Q.1. Wap in C to take two input from the user and perform arithmetic, relational, bitwise operator and print the output.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
	int a,b;
	printf("ENTER THE TWO NUMBER\n");
	scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	printf("ADDITION IS %d\n",(a+b));
	printf("SUBTRACTION IS %d\n",(a-b));
	printf("MULTIPLICATION IS %d\n",(a*b));
	printf("DIVISION IS %d\n",(a/b));
	printf("MODULUS IS %d\n",(a%b));
	printf("EQUAL TO IS %d\n",(a==b));
	printf("NOT EQUAL TO IS %d\n",(a!=b));
	printf("LESS THAN IS %d\n",(a<b));
	printf("LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO IS %d\n",(a<=b));
	printf("GREATER THAN IS %d\n",(a>b));
	printf("GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO IS %d\n",(a>=b));
	printf("BITWISE AND %d\n",(a&b));
	printf("BITWISE OR %d\n",(a|b));
	printf("BITWISE NOT %d\n",(~a));
	printf("BITWISE NOT %d\n",(~b));
	printf("BITWISE XOR %d\n",(a^b));
	printf("BITWISE LEFT SHIFT %d\n",(2<<a));
	printf("BITWISE RIGHT SHIFT %d\n",(a>>2));
	getch();
	return 0;
}


  Q.2. WAP in C which uses two variables to perform various arithmetic operations.
  
  #include<stdio.h>
  #include<conio.h>
  int main()
  {
	int a,b;
	printf("ENTER THE TWO NUMBER\n");
	scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	printf("ADDITION IS %d\n",(a+b));
	printf("SUBTRACTION IS %d\n",(a-b));
	printf("MULTIPLICATION IS %d\n",(a*b));
	printf("DIVISION IS %d\n",(a/b));
	printf("MODULUS IS %d\n",(a%b));
	getch();
	return 0;
}
